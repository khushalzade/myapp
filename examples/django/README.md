# Example Django integration

This folder contains an example Django project using Matomo with Django
integration.

If you also want to run it, then you need to install Django and a recent
version of Matomo package (at least 0.7). You will also need to set
`MATOMO_SITE_ID` and `MATOMO_TRACKING_API_URL` in `local_settings.py`
